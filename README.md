# social-network-api

Description
This project has allowed me to focus on backend database building using MongoDB/Mongoose, a NoSQL programming language. As a full-stack developer, I aim to strengthen my skills in both backend and frontend design and structure. Having experience in building a social network database is crucial in today's world, as many applications and companies rely on such databases. With this application, I want to showcase my ability to create social networking functionality and demonstrate the data flow between backend and frontend in web development.
